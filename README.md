# House Price Prediction Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset undergoes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to develop an accurate predictive model.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Name:** `Housing.csv`   
- **Description:** Contains real estate data with various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and other attributes affecting house prices.  

## 🚀 Key Steps  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Handling Missing Values  
   - Detecting and Removing Outliers  
   - Feature Importance Analysis  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Scaling using Robust Scaler  
   - Encoding Categorical Variables  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Splitting data into Train & Test sets  
   - Training models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
   - Evaluating performance using RMSE, R² Score, and MAE  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Train-Test Split, Feature Scaling, Model Training)

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House_Price_Prediction.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh  
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn  
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```sh  
   jupyter notebook House_Price_Pred.ipynb  
   ```  

## 📀 Results & Insights  
- This project predicts the house of a price based on certain factors including area,no .of rooms , bathrooms , guestrooms , etc . I've also considered multiple collinearity problem and tried feature engineering to overcome it. 

Would you like me to add more details, such as model performance results or visualization insights? 🚀
